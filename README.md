### Tasks

Here are some tasks for you to work on:

To delete a book, pass the bookId to be deleted, eg:
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/{bookId} using the delete method.

If the book is not deleted successfully,user will see an error with message:Book id was not found.

Error handling is done using a custom Error object which holds status code, the error message.
We can create a custom error object like a badRequestError by extending the customError object, and set the appropriate status code,error message depending on the situation. For eg., when the user hits http://localhost:3000/api/v1/books/{bookId} with a GET method to get a book by the bookId, the server returns an error with "201" status code since the DB does not have a book by that id.
